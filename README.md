## Project Overview

This is a local-only, single-user note-taking application built as a portfolio project. The goal is to demonstrate a clean, end-to-end architecture using a modern Vue frontend, a lightweight Node/Express backend, and a SQLite database, with an emphasis on clarity, testability, and maintainable state management.

The application supports basic note management functionality: creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. Notes can be searched using a simple text query and filtered based on their creation date.

## Core Features

- Create, edit, delete, and list notes
- Search notes by case-insensitive text match on title and content
- Filter notes by creation date
- Local persistence using SQLite
- Frontend state management with Pinia
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
